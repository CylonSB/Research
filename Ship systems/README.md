# Ship systems [WIP]
This collection of projects indends to explore all ship systems, for example:
 - Generator output with varied limits & enhancers
 - Coolent system setup & flow rates
 - YOLOL based ship control systems

With the general aim of providing simple formulae for calculating expected power draw, fuel requirments, flight time. etc. And then the YOLOL system to monitor all of this automatically
